# Loan-Prediction
In this repository the code for loan prediction is available. A project regarding the predicting of loan amount using variable such as credit, income, and debt-to-income ratio was developed. Using a bayesian network method called hill-climbing, there seemed to be a solidified direction from income to loan amount. Hill-climbing had the best score out of the bayesian networks tested and mean sqaured-error (MSE) was used to test the accuracy of the loan amount predictions to the actual loan amounts reported. 

Additionally, using this same data, a project was conducted using different methods to examine loan approval. Supervised methods such as logistic regression and random forest were used to determine how well approval compared to denial for loans could be predicted. The methods generated over 90% accuracy in determining if the individual had been approved or denied. Unsupervised methods such as k-means clustering and bayesian networks (mentioned above) were compared to determine what groupings or relationships the predictors had with each other. Finally, a bag-of-words technique was used for text data in which each individual had a sentence explaining the reason they needed a loan. A comparison of the words used for those who were approved versus those who has been denied indicated that most people, regardless of loan status, were looking to start a business or pay expenses like cars or medical.
